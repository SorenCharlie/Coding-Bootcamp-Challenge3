## Description
This application allows the end user to add as many employees as they wish and stores the information entered.
Given parital code, I created an array to store employee's first name, last name, and salary. 
I used isNaN to ensure the salary defaults to 0 if a number is not entered.
I used a while loop to allow the user to continue adding employees until they click cancel.
Then I calculated the average salary using the entered values using a for loop
Then I used Math objects to generate a random employee

## Usage
Once you've loaded the page, click Add Employees.
You will get a series of prompts to enter the employee's first name, last name, and salary.
Enter the value and click OK to move to the next prompt.
If you do not enter a number for the salary, it will default to 0.
Once you've enterd all the information for an employee, you will be asked if you wnat to add another employee.
Click OK to continue, Cancel to end.
When you click Cancel, you will see a table populate for all the employees entered.

If you inspect the page and go to the console, you will see the average salary and a random employee.
